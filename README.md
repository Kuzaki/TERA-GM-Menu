# TERA-GM-Menu

Special Thanks to 레이븐 for sharing the opcode for NA/EU.
Special Thanks to superseriousmeme for finding it.

Allows you to open GM Menu in TERA. Can be opened by right clicking a player or by Alt+A.
You will not be able to use trade, duel, inspect. It will be replaced with 'Review User Info' when right clicking someone in game. 
Do it maually.

[How to install]

1) Make sure you have the latest version of Proxy and latest version of tera-data by meishuu.

2) Extract the .def files to tera-proxy\node_modules\tera-data\protocol

3) Go to tera-proxy\tera-proxy\node_modules\tera-data\map and open protocol.319982.map and paste in S_QA_SET_ADMIN_LEVEL = 51479 at the bottom. I'll add the EU opcode later. Works for NA only right now.

4) Save file.

5) Extract mod to tera-proxy\tera-proxy\bin\node_modules.

6) Enjoy!
